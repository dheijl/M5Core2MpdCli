# M5Core2MpdCli

Simple MPD client (Arduino) with the M5Stack Core2.

It is the [M5stack M5Core2](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/core2) of my no longer maintained [WiotMpdcli project](https://github.com/dheijl/WiotMpdcli), with similar function and use.

The joystick function of the Seeed Wio Terminal is replaced by the 3 on-screen touch buttons (up/select/down), and the menu is activated with the middle (select) button.

WIP: add touch navigation and selection to the menu.
